in TAAA,,,,,
abstracts for the extraction of sematic terms from chatgpt,,,,,
the results as coword occurrences from coword text in anaimalzoocoword.csv,,,,,
cluster analysis is performed and themes are asigned to each cluster by sematic terms from chatgpt,,,,,
"finally, 3 csv downloaded files are provided: vertice data, relation data for top 20 terms and document data with additional variable for theme assigned to the respective article",,,,,
2 plots are generared: scatter plot and h-based major terms(themes),,,,,
,,,,,

Expected CSV Outputs after v4.7 update,,,,,
,,,,,
File,Content,Purpose,,,
*_vertices.csv,"term, count, edge, cluster",Node-level statistics,,,
*_relations.csv,"Source, Target, edge",Co-word relationships,,,
*_themed.csv,"theme, [original columns]",Assigned theme per document,,,
"In the current version I gave you, when you upload a CSV (say, containing abstracts), the app does the following:",,,,,
,,,,,
1. Reads it safely (UTF-8/Big5 fallback).,,,,,
,,,,,
2. Extracts keywords from each row.,,,,,
,,,,,
3. Builds edges (co-word pairs).,,,,,
,,,,,
4. Runs Louvain clustering → groups terms into themes.,,,,,
,,,,,
5. Creates two downloadable files:,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
"*_vertices.csv → each term, with its frequency count, total edge sum, and cluster ID.",,,,,
,,,,,
"*_relations.csv → each term pair, with its co-occurrence frequency.",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
"therefore, to run a demo locally (TF-IDF mode) using the animalzoocoword.csv so you can visually preview both the scatter and bar (theme) plots and verify that _themed.csv now has the new “theme” column",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
integrating every feature discussed so far:,,,,,
,,,,,
? Robust UTF-8 handling (no garbled text),,,,,
? Dual modes (co-word vs. abstract),,,,,
? Vertex + relation + cluster + H-theme + top-20 scatter outputs,,,,,
? Theme assignment for each article in abstract mode (TAAA),,,,,
? Cluster legend (clusters.csv),,,,,
? Intelligent selection of top 20 terms via tiered cluster rule,,,,,
"? Fully annotated, production-ready for Render or GPT Store deployment",,,,,
