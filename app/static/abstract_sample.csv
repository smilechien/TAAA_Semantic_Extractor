"Light-sheet microscopy is an imaging approach that offers unique advantages for a diverse range of neuroscience applications. Unlike point-scanning techniques such as confocal and two-photon microscopy, light-sheet microscopes illuminate an entire plane of tissue, while imaging this plane onto a camera. Although early implementations of light sheet were optimized for longitudinal imaging of embryonic development in small specimens, emerging implementations are capable of capturing light-sheet images in freely moving, unconstrained specimens and even the intact in vivo mammalian brain. Meanwhile, the unique photobleaching and signal-to-noise benefits afforded by light-sheet microscopy's parallelized detection deliver the ability to perform volumetric imaging at much higher speeds than can be achieved using point scanning. This review describes the basic principles and evolution of light-sheet microscopy, followed by perspectives on emerging applications and opportunities for both imaging large, cleared, and expanded neural tissues and high-speed, functional imaging in vivo."
"Light sheet microscopy is an easy to implement and extremely powerful alternative to established fluorescence imaging techniques such as laser scanning confocal, multi-photon and spinning disk microscopy. By illuminating the sample only with a thin slice of light, photo-bleaching is reduced to a minimum, making light sheet microscopy ideal for non-destructive imaging of fragile samples over extended periods of time. Millimeter-sized samples can be imaged rapidly with high resolution and high depth penetration. A large variety of instruments have been developed and optimized for a number of different samples: Bessel beams form thin light sheets for single cells, and selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) offers multi-view acquisition to image entire embryos with isotropic resolution. This review explains how light sheet microscopy involves a conceptually new microscope design and how it changes modern imaging in biology."
"Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a powerful method for rapid and optically efficient 3D microscopy. Initial LSFM designs utilized a static sheet of light, termed selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), which exhibited shadowing artifacts and deteriorated contrast due to light scattering. These issues have been addressed, in part, by multidirectional selective plane illumination microscopy (mSPIM), in which rotation of the light sheet is used to mitigate shadowing artifacts, and digital scanned light-sheet microscopy (DSLM), in which confocal line detection is used to reject scattered light. Here we present a simple and passive multidirectional digital scanned light-sheet microscopy (mDSLM) architecture that combines the benefits of mSPIM and DSLM. By utilizing an elliptical Gaussian beam with increased angular diversity in the imaging plane, mDSLM provides mitigation of shadowing artifacts and contrast-enhanced imaging of fluorescently labeled samples."
"Light sheet fluorescence microscopy is an efficient method for imaging large volumes of biological tissue, including brains of larval zebrafish, at high spatial and fairly high temporal resolution with minimal phototoxicity. Here, we provide a practical guide for those who intend to build a light sheet microscope for fluorescence imaging in live larval zebrafish brains or other tissues."
"In light sheet microscopy, optical sectioning by selective fluorescence excitation with a sheet of light is combined with fast full-frame acquisition. This illumination scheme provides minimal photobleaching and phototoxicity. Complemented with remote focusing and multi-view acquisition, light sheet microscopy is the method of choice for acquisition of very fast biological processes, large samples, and high-throughput applications in areas such as neuroscience, plant biology, and developmental biology. This review explains why light sheet microscopes are much faster and gentler than other established fluorescence microscopy techniques. New volumetric imaging schemes and highlights of selected biological applications are also discussed."
"Light-sheet microscopy stands out as a powerful tool in biological imaging due to its exceptional performance in fluorescence imaging. However, achieving both high sectioning performance and a vast field of view (FOV) poses a fundamental challenge in conventional light-sheet microscopy. The light-sheet thickness is typically constrained to 1 mu m for a wide FOV, potentially compromising resolution. To address this limitation, an axial scanning light-sheet microscopy (ASLM) technique integrated with aberration-free tunable foci to enable high-NA excitation while maintaining a generous FOV, is introduced. The proposed scheme successfully achieves isotropic resolution of 280 nm in a 3D imaging system, encompassing a FOV of 80 x 80 mu m and an impressive imaging speed of 80 ms per frame. These remarkable characteristics underscore the immense potential of ASLM for high- spatiotemporal resolution imaging. Light-sheet microscopy is a powerful tool in biological imaging, but achieving high sectioning performance and large field of view (FOV) is still a challenge. The axial scanning light-sheet microscopy with aberration-free tunable foci addresses this limitation, achieving isotropic resolution of 280 nm in 3D with FOV of 80 x 80 mu m, highlighting its potential for high spatiotemporal resolution imaging. image"
"Ten years of development in light-sheet microscopy have led to spectacular demonstrations of its capabilities. The technology is ready to assist biologists in tackling scientific problems, but are biologists ready for it? Here we discuss the interdisciplinary challenges light-sheet microscopy presents for biologists and highlight available resources."
"Capturing dynamic processes in live samples is a nontrivial task in biological imaging. Although fluorescence provides high specificity and contrast compared to other light microscopy techniques, the photophysical principles of this method can have a harmful effect on the sample. Current advances in light sheet microscopy have created a novel imaging toolbox that allows for rapid acquisition of high resolution fluorescent images with minimal perturbation of the processes of interest. Each unique design has its own advantages and limitations. In this review, we describe several cutting edge light sheet microscopes and their optimal applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Single-molecule super-resolution imaging is a new promising tool for investigation of sub-cellular structures. Concurrently, light-sheet microscopy, also known as selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), has gained rapid favor with the imaging community in developmental biology due to its fast speed, high contrast, deep penetration, and low phototoxicity. While nearly a dozen reviews thoroughly describe the development of light-sheet microscopy and its technological breakthroughs with a main focus on improving the 3D imaging speed of fish embryos, central nervous system, and other tissues, few have addressed the potential of combining light-sheet microscopy and localization-based super-resolution imaging to achieve sub-diffraction-limited resolution. Adapting light-sheet illumination for single-molecule imaging presents unique challenges for instrumentation and reconstruction algorithms. In this Minireview, we provide an overview of the recent developments that address these challenges. We compare different approaches in super-resolution and light-sheet imaging, address advantages and limitations in each approach, and outline future directions of this emerging field."
"We implemented two-photon scanned light-sheet microscopy, combining nonlinear excitation with orthogonal illumination of light-sheet microscopy, and showed its excellent performance for in vivo, cellular-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of large biological samples. Live imaging of fruit fly and zebrafish embryos confirmed that the technique can be used to image up to twice deeper than with one-photon light-sheet microscopy and more than ten times faster than with point-scanning two-photon microscopy without compromising normal biology."
"In this review, the future of fluorescence imaging with light sheets is discussed, together with the advent of adaptive and smart imaging schemes. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has transformed our ability to visualize and quantitatively measure biological processes rapidly and over long time periods. In this review, we discuss current and future developments in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy that we expect to further expand its capabilities. This includes smart and adaptive imaging schemes to overcome traditional imaging trade-offs, i.e., spatiotemporal resolution, field of view and sample health. In smart microscopy, a microscope will autonomously decide where, when, what and how to image. We further assess how image restoration techniques provide avenues to overcome these tradeoffs and how open top light-sheet microscopes may enable multi-modal imaging with high throughput. As such, we predict that light-sheet microscopy will fulfill an important role in biomedical and clinical imaging in the future."
"The ability to visualize and quantitatively measure dynamic biological processes in vivo and at high spatiotemporal resolution is of fundamental importance to experimental investigations in developmental biology. Light-sheet microscopy is particularly well suited to providing such data, since it offers exceptionally high imaging speed and good spatial resolution while minimizing light-induced damage to the specimen. We review core principles and recent advances in light-sheet microscopy, with a focus on concepts and implementations relevant for applications in developmental biology. We discuss how light-sheet microcopy has helped advance our understanding of developmental processes from single-molecule to whole-organism studies, assess the potential for synergies with other state-of-the-art technologies, and introduce methods for computational image and data analysis. Finally, we explore the future trajectory of light-sheet microscopy, discuss key efforts to disseminate new light-sheet technology, and identify exciting opportunities for further advances."
"We introduce field synthesis, a theorem and method that can be used to synthesize any scanned or dithered light sheet, including those used in lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), from an incoherent superposition of one-dimensional intensity distributions. Compared to LLSM, this user-friendly and modular approach offers a simplified optical design, higher light throughput and simultaneous multicolor illumination. Further, field synthesis achieves lower rates of photobleaching than light sheets generated by lateral beam scanning."
"Light sheet microscopy is the ideal imaging technique to study zebrafish embryonic development. Due to minimal photo-toxicity and bleaching, it is particularly suited for long-term time-lapse imaging over many hours up to several days. However, an appropriate sample mounting strategy is needed that offers both confinement and normal development of the sample. Multilayer mounting, a new embedding technique using low-concentration agarose in optically clear tubes, now overcomes this limitation and unleashes the full potential of light sheet microscopy for real-time developmental biology."
"Sample-induced image-degradation remains an intricate wave-optical problem in light-sheet microscopy. Here we present biobeam, an open-source software package that enables simulation of operational light-sheet microscopes by combining data from 10(5)-10(6) multiplexed and GPU-accelerated point-spread-function calculations. The wave-optical nature of these simulations leads to the faithful reproduction of spatially varying aberrations, diffraction artifacts, geometric image distortions, adaptive optics, and emergent wave-optical phenomena, and renders image-formation in light-sheet microscopy computationally tractable."
"Light-sheet microscopy offers new possibilities to efficiently visualize large tissue samples in three dimensions. Volumetric 3D imaging can uncover detailed information about the inner landscape of tumors, which can improve cancer diagnosis and therapy. This Forum article highlights the advantages of using light-sheet microscopy for pathological examinations of intact tumor specimens."
